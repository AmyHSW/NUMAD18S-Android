    <string name="about_text">\
        Scroggle stands for Scrambled Boggle. At the start of the game, a 9x9 grid with 9x9
        letters in the grid is displayed. Each smaller grid has been populated with
        9-letter words using Boggle rules (up/down/diagonal letters are connected).
        \n\
        In phase 1, which lasts for 1.5 min, you need to find the longest word in each
        Boggle board. Once the word is selected, the remaining letters in that grid disappear.
        \n\
        The game enters phase 2 after 1.5 min, or after you have done all 9 Boggle boards,
        depends on which one comes first. In phase 2, you will pick one letter from each quadrant.
        You can revisit grids, but not back to back. The score you earn depends on the length
        of the word you build and the letters the word contains.
        \n\
        Enjoy!!!
